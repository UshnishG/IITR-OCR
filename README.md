# Multi-Language OCR and Keyword Search Application

## Overview

This **Multi-Language OCR and Keyword Search** application is built using **Streamlit**, **EasyOCR**, and **PIL** to allow users to extract text from images containing both **Hindi** and **English** languages. After extracting the text, users can search for specific keywords within the extracted text and download the results in **JSON** or **TXT** format.

## Features

- **Multi-language OCR**: Extracts text from images containing both Hindi and English using the EasyOCR library.
- **Keyword Highlighting**: Search for specific keywords within the extracted text, with the matches highlighted for easy identification.
- **Download Options**: Allows users to download the extracted text in **JSON** or **TXT** formats.
- **Streamlit UI**: A simple and interactive user interface for uploading images and interacting with the text extraction process.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Ensure that `requirements.txt` contains the following libraries:
   ```
   streamlit
   easyocr
   pillow
   numpy
   ```
   
### Running the Web Application Locally

1. **Start the Streamlit Application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

   Replace `app.py` with the name of your Python file if it's different.

2. **Open in Browser**
   After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (usually `http://localhost:8501`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the application.

## Deployment Process

You can deploy the application using various platforms such as **Streamlit Sharing**, **Heroku**, or **AWS**. Below are brief instructions for deploying on Streamlit Sharing.

   - Click "Deploy".

4. **Access the Deployed Application**
   After deployment, youâ€™ll receive a public URL where your application is accessible.

### Notes for Deployment

- Ensure that your `requirements.txt` is up to date with all necessary packages.
